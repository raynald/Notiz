# Discovery Management

### 1. Entrepreneurial Management
There is only 
#### 1.1 Entrepreneurial challenges
##### 1.1.1 Innovation process
1. Idea generation, 
2. idea screening, 
3. concept testing, 
4. market strategy development, 
5. business analysis, 
6. product development, 
7. market testing, 
8. commercialization

##### 1.1.2 Exploration vs. Exploitation
There is a tradeoff between modes of discovering and executing
- **Exploration**: search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation; the costs of experimentaion without any of its benefits, undeveloped ideas, little distinctive competence, long-term, risky, uncertain
- **Exploitation**: refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution, locked-in to suboptimal equilibria, can't adapt to changing circumstances, short-term, immediate, certain benefits

##### 1.1.3 Causation vs. effectuation
- **Causation**: Causation process take a particular effect as given and focus on seleccting between means to create that effect (**Traditional Management**)
- **Effectuation**: Effectuation processes take a set of means as given and focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means. (**Entrepreneurial Management**)

Both processes have fundamentally different charateristics
[table]

Entrepreneurs make the shift from "economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency"

Effectuation
- Birds-in-hand, do the doable, then push it
- Manage the loss, not the profit
- Make other people have a stake

### 2. HRM
- **Definition**: HRM concerns the policies, practices, and systems that influence employees' behavior, attitudes, and performance.

- **Goal**: HRM aims at applying human resources within organizations such that people succeed and organizational performance improves.

- **Effects**: 
    HRM-practices(especially job design and selection/appraisal/training) better predict company performance than R&D, QM, strategy and technology
    Empowerment better predicts company performance than technology-based management practices in the short- and long-term
    HRM-practices as cause and effect of company performance

- **Characteristics**: 
    - Selective hiring
        - Protopyical proceure in personnel selection: Planing, Implementation, Evaluation
        - Validity of different selection methods: personality disposition, behavioral simulation, biographical focus
    - Extensive training
        - Personnel development: systematic furthering of personal aptitude in relation to individual expectations and organizational requirements: education/training, counselling/coaching, management by objectives, team development, job design
        - Basic assumption of personnel development:
            Dynamic relationship between person and work: person and work change continuously, requiring also continuosu adaptation
            Adaptation can happen from the perspective of "fit human to task" and/or "fit task to human": define possible career paths: e.g., management versus technical career; identify individual career needs: e.g., different types of career orientations
    - Self-managed teams and decentralization
        Teams: several people who work together over a period of time to reach common goals and who share a sense of belonging together
        Self-regulation: individual and collective autonomy in order to coordinate work processes and to cope with process variances and uncertainties locally
        Prerequisites for good team work
            - Adequate common task 
                - Complexity higher than individual competencies
                - Clear performance criteria
                - Collective decision competence
            - Shared goal orientation
                - Positive goal coupling
                - Goal transparency and feedback
            - Adequate group composition
                - Different perspectives on the task
                - Shared language
            - Development of group rules
                - Adequate group size
                - Support for team development (form, storm, norm, perform)
                - Handling conflicts between individual and collective autonomy
    - Reduction of status differences
        Changing context for leadership
            Boundaryless, flattened, flexible, projected-based and team-based organizations that employ temporary, externalized and remote workers, whose tasks are more intellectual and less routine and cannot be controlled and coordinated by structure or direct supervision, need mechanisms and coordination through shared meaning systems and a shared sense of purpose
        Management of uncertainty as strategic and operational leadership function
            Balance between **minimizing uncertainty**, which creates stability, and **coping with uncertainty**, which creates flexibility
            **Stability**: central planning, high standardization, high level of automation, little operative freedom, feedforward control
            **Flexibility**: planning as local resource, little standardization, support through technology, high degrees of freedom, feedback control
        New issues in leadership
            **Leadership portfolios**: in order to match different situational demands with adequate leadership behaviors, leaders must develop portfolios of styles and behaviors and understand when to use which behavior
            **Shared leadership**: Leadership involves different tasks that can be taken on by different team members and may shift between team members.
    - High compensation contingent on organizational performance
        Pay is: money, compensation, reward, incentive, recognition
        Procedural and distributive justice of pay systems at least as important as absolute amount of own pay
        Performance-related pay
            - A part of the overal pay is determined on the basis of individual/group/company performance
            - Increasing use
                - in the US more than in Europe
                - for managers more than for non-managerial employees
                - in larger companies more than i smaller companies
            - Critical voices become louder:
                - Is the rewarded behavior the desired behavior?
                - Danger of reducing intrinsic motivation
                - Conflict between individual and team performance
            - Pay schemes related to organizational performance tend to avoid these problems
    - Sharing information
        
    - Employment security
        - Employment relationship: social exchange defined by legal and psychological contracts
            Legal contract
            Psychological contract
        - Flexible working: any time, any place, contract work, pay for performance
            Change from a traditional to a new contract
                Traditional contract: job security/life-long employment, internal promotion, specialization, loyalty/identification
                New contract: flexibility/accepting insecurity, internal development, goal/performance orientation, employability/focus on own competencies
        - Using the psychological contract to handle employment uncertainties
            - Communicate and match reciprocal expectations and offers
            - Support employability through training, job design, and systematic career management
            - Distribute risks between organization and employee according to individual coping capabilities
    
    Beyond "rational choice": HRM-practices as expression of organizational culture
        - Organizational culture implies
            - Assumptions about human nature (e.g., motivation, trust versus control)
            - Images of organizations (e.g., brain, machine, family) 
            - Assumptions about how organizations work best (e.g., centralization versus decentralization)
        - These assumptions strongly influence choices of HRM practices beyond and possibly even against empirical evidence.

### 4. Introduction to Negotiation
#### 4.1 Basic Concepts
    What is negotiation: Exchanges between parties designed to reconcile their differences and produce a settlement.
    Taxonomy: [Graph]
    Distributive vs. integrative negotiation
        Distributive negotiation: competitive, one issue, win-lose approach
        Integrative negotiation: mutual gains, many issues, win-win approach
##### 4.1.2 Rationality
    1. Definition often used
    Rational under certainty
    Rational under uncertainty
    2. Definition: Rational behavior 
    Behaving rationally
    3. Our hypothesis
    Conducted/monitored by professional persons of the negotiation party
    Of which a couple of persons are not directly participating in the negotiation but work in a sort of "back-office" / "head-office" functions
    Where the work culture permits an internal objective/criticla  
#### 4.2 Negotiation Theories 
##### 4.2.1 Harvard Method
    1. People: separate the people from the problem
    2. Interests: focus on interests, not positions
    3. Options: Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do
    4. Criteria: Insist that the result are based on some objective standard
##### 4.2.2 Game Theory
    * Analysis of strategic decision-making and conflict of interests among the players
    * Result of the decision-making depends on the other players' decisions
    * Strictly formalized by means of mathematical models
    * Founder of the game theory: John von Neumann

    Prisoners' Dilemma: Pareto, Nash
#### 4.3 Current Case
##### 4.3.1 Definition
    Negotiation engineering: th application of a process by which a complex negotiatio problem is divided into sub-problems in order to make them easier solvable; and the use of scientific or other methods based on objective criteria to solve the above mentioned sub-problems

##### 4.4.1 Phases of negotiation
    1. Recognize/identify the problem
    2. Explore negotiation possibilities
    3. Get a mandate

    5. Initial, if practice
    6. Signing
    7. Approval, if necessary
    8. Entry into force
    9. Open the champagne

    - Explore the situation well: Get the maximum of information on:
        - The problem
        - The other side's position
        - Your possibilities
    - Mandate-drafting is decisive:
        - Draft it yourself, if possible
        - Mandate should be ambitious, but reasonable/realistic so that later adaptions do not become necessary
