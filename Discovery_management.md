# Discovery Management

### 1. Entrepreneurial Management
- Starbucks is bringing "inspiration"
- Toyota reinvented "how things got made", which enabled it to build cars faster and with less labor

#### 1.1 Entrepreneurial challenges
##### 1.1.1 Innovation process are efficient organizational structures - but do not save us from lock-in
1. Idea generation, 
2. idea screening, 
3. concept testing, 
4. market strategy development, 
5. business analysis, 
6. product development, 
7. market testing, 
8. commercialization

##### 1.1.2 Exploration vs. Exploitation
In the nature organizations, there is a tradeoff between modes of discovering and executing

- **Exploration**: search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation; the costs of experimentaion without any of its benefits, undeveloped ideas, little distinctive competence, long-term, risky, uncertain
- **Exploitation**: refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution, locked-in to suboptimal equilibria, can't adapt to changing circumstances, short-term, immediate, certain benefits

##### 1.1.3 Causation vs. effectuation
- **Causation**: Causation process take a particular effect as given and focus on seleccting between means to create that effect (**Traditional Management**)
- **Effectuation**: Effectuation processes take a set of means as given and focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means. (**Entrepreneurial Management**)

Both processes have fundamentally different charateristics
    [table]

Entrepreneurs make the shift from "economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency"

Effectuation

- Birds-in-hand: do the doable, then push it
- Affordable loss: Manage the loss, not the profit
- Crazy quilt: Make other people have a stake

### 2. HRM
- **Definition**: HRM concerns the policies, practices, and systems that influence employees' behavior, attitudes, and performance.

- **Goal**: HRM aims at applying human resources within organizations such that people succeed and organizational performance improves.

- **Effects**: 
	- HRM-practices(especially job design and selection/appraisal/training) better predict company performance than R&D, QM, strategy and technology

	- Empowerment better predicts company performance than technology-based management practices in the short- and long-term

	- HRM-practices as cause and effect of company performance

- **Characteristics**: 
    - Selective hiring
        - Protopyical procedure in personnel selection: Planing, Implementation, Evaluation
        - Validity of different selection methods: personality disposition, behavioral simulation, biographical focus
    - Extensive training
        - Personnel development: systematic furthering of personal aptitude in relation to individual expectations and organizational requirements: 
            - education/training, counselling/coaching, management by objectives, team development, job design
        - Basic assumption of personnel development:
            - Dynamic relationship between person and work: person and work change continuously, requiring also continuosu adaptation
            - Adaptation can happen from the perspective of "fit human to task" and/or "fit task to human": 
                - define possible career paths: e.g., management versus technical career
                - identify individual career needs: e.g., different types of career orientations
    - Self-managed teams and decentralization
        - Teams: several people who work together over a period of time to reach common goals and who share a sense of belonging together
        - Self-regulation: individual and collective autonomy in order to coordinate work processes and to cope with process variances and uncertainties locally
        - Prerequisites for good team work
            - Adequate common task 
                - Complexity higher than individual competencies
                - Clear performance criteria
                - Collective decision competence
            - Shared goal orientation
                - Positive goal coupling
                - Goal transparency and feedback
            - Adequate group composition
                - Different perspectives on the task
                - Shared language
            - Development of group rules
                - Adequate group size
                - Support for team development (form, storm, norm, perform)
                - Handling conflicts between individual and collective autonomy
    - Reduction of status differences
        - Changing context for leadership
            - How do I lead a company, how do we lead a company, how does a company lead itself?
            - Boundaryless, flattened, flexible, projected-based and team-based organizations that employ temporary, externalized and remote workers, whose tasks are more intellectual and less routine and cannot be controlled and coordinated by structure or direct supervision, need mechanisms and coordination through shared meaning systems and a shared sense of purpose
        - Management of uncertainty as strategic and operational leadership function
            - Balance between **minimizing uncertainty**, which creates stability, and **coping with uncertainty**, which creates flexibility
            
            **Stability**: central planning, high standardization, high level of automation, little operative freedom, feedforward control
            
            **Flexibility**: planning as local resource, little standardization, support through technology, high degrees of freedom, feedback control
            
        - New issues in leadership
            - **Leadership portfolios**: in order to match different situational demands with adequate leadership behaviors, leaders must develop portfolios of styles and behaviors and understand when to use which behavior
            - **Shared leadership**: Leadership involves different tasks that can be taken on by different team members and may shift between team members.
    - High compensation contingent on organizational performance
        - Pay is: money, compensation, reward, incentive, recognition
        - Procedural and distributive justice of pay systems at least as important as absolute amount of own pay
        - Performance-related pay
            - A part of the overal pay is determined on the basis of individual/group/company performance
            - Increasing use
                - in the US more than in Europe
                - for managers more than for non-managerial employees
                - in larger companies more than i smaller companies
            - Critical voices become louder:
                - Is the rewarded behavior the desired behavior?
                - Danger of reducing intrinsic motivation
                - Conflict between individual and team performance
            - Pay schemes related to organizational performance tend to avoid these problems
    - Sharing information
    - Employment security
        - Employment relationship: social exchange defined by legal and psychological contracts
            - Legal contract
            - Psychological contract
        - Flexible working: any time, any place, contract work, pay for performance
            - Change from a traditional to a new contract
                - Traditional contract: job security/life-long employment, internal promotion, specialization, loyalty/identification
                - New contract: flexibility/accepting insecurity, internal development, goal/performance orientation, employability/focus on own competencies
        - Using the psychological contract to handle employment uncertainties
            - Communicate and match reciprocal expectations and offers
            - Support employability through training, job design, and systematic career management
            - Distribute risks between organization and employee according to individual coping capabilities
    
    - Beyond *rational choice*: HRM-practices as expression of organizational culture
        - Organizational culture implies
            - Assumptions about human nature (e.g., motivation, trust versus control)
            - Images of organizations (e.g., brain, machine, family) 
            - Assumptions about how organizations work best (e.g., centralization versus decentralization)
        - These assumptions strongly influence choices of HRM practices beyond and possibly even against empirical evidence.

### 4. Introduction to Negotiation
#### 4.1 Basic Concepts
- What is negotiation: Exchanges between parties designed to reconcile their differences and produce a settlement.
- Taxonomy: [Graph]
- Distributive vs. integrative negotiation
    - Distributive negotiation: competitive, one issue, win-lose approach
		- usually involves a single issue - a "fixed-pie" - in which one person gains at the expense of the other. For example, haggling over the price of a rug in a bazaar is a distributive negotiation.
    
    - Integrative negotiation: mutual gains, many issues, win-win approach
    	- the outcomes available are no longer a "fixed-pie" divided among all parties. An agreement can be found that is better for both parites than what they would have reached through distributive negotiation.

##### 4.1.2 Rationality
1. Definition often used
Rational under certainty: completeness, transitivity
Rational under uncertainty: completeness, transitivity, monotonicity, continuity, independence

2. Definition: Rational behavior 
*Behaving rationally* means
- the negotiaiotn _objectives_ are based on comprehensive motivations and 
- the _measures_ to achieve these objectives are consistent and do not violate generally acceptable conventions/customes.

3. Our hypothesis
Negotiation aprties will be considered as *behaving rationally* if
- The negotiation is Conducted/monitored by professional persons of the negotiation party
- Of which a couple of persons are not directly participating in the negotiation but work in a sort of "back-office" / "head-office" functions
- Where the work culture permits an internal objective/criticla  

#### 4.2 Negotiation Theories 
##### 4.2.1 Harvard Method
1. People: separate the people from the problem
2. Interests: focus on interests, not positions
3. Options: Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do
4. Criteria: Insist that the result are based on some objective standard

##### 4.2.2 Game Theory
* Analysis of *strategic decision-making* and conflict of interests among the players
* Result of the decision-making depends on *the other players' decisions*
* Strictly formalized by means of *mathematical models*
* Founder of the game theory: John von Neumann

Prisoners' Dilemma: Pareto, Nash

#### 4.3 Current Case
##### 4.3.1 Definition
*Negotiation engineering*
 - the application of a process by which a complex negotiatio problem is divided into sub-problems in order to make them easier solvable; 
 - the use of scientific or other methods based on objective criteria to solve the above mentioned sub-problems

##### 4.3.2 Case studies
##### 4.3.2.1 Iran-P5+1\*:Nuclear question
1. Backgroud
2. Negotiation/Swiss mediation
3. Result
4. Conclusion

##### 4.3.2.2 CH-EU Land Transport Agreement
1. Background
2. Negotiation
3. Results
4. Conclusion

#### 4.4 Negotiation Process
##### 4.4.1 Phases of negotiation
1. Recognize/identify the problem
2. Explore negotiation possibilities
3. Get a mandate
4. Negotiate within your mandate. If you have to change the mandate, you should be sure, that it is final.
5. Initial, if practice
6. Signing
7. Approval, if necessary
8. Entry into force
9. Open the champagne

##### 4.4.2 Preparation for negotiation
- Explore the situation well: Get the maximum of information on:
    - The problem
    - The other side's position
    - Your possibilities
- Mandate-drafting is decisive:
    - Draft it yourself, if possible
    - Mandate should be ambitious, but reasonable/realistic so that later adaptions do not become necessary

##### 4.4.3 Behavioral and cultural aspects
All in all:
- Always gaol oriented and objective
- Intellectually skeptical and distrustful
- Creative
- Polite

#### 4.5 ETH-NECOM Recommendations
1. Before asking for, accepting, or refusing a negotiation, make a thorough analysis. 
2. Negotiate in good faith, create confidence, while remaining critical.
3. Stick to a coherent linen of argumentation and stick to your engagement in the negotiation.
4. Proceed carefully in the negotiation
5. Demands/Counter Demands.
6. Negotiation Engineering
7. When there are several issues on the table, link them together.
8. If you have a bigger interest in a negotiated solution than the other side, make proposals that solve the problem of the other side (while evidently fulfilling your own requirements).
9. Proceed in phases.

### 5. Logistics, Operations, and Supply Chain Management
#### 5.1 Basic Definitions, Issues, and Challenges
- A *good* is something that has an economic utility or satisfies an economic want
- The noun form of an adjective with the meaning
    - formerly: fitting in a building or human society
    - today: suitable, serviceable, convenient or effective
- A *produce* is something produced as commodity or similar
- A *product* is something brought about by intellectual or physical effort
- An *artifact* is something created by humans, usually for a practical purpose
- *Materials* are the elements, consituents or substances of which something is composed or can be made. Beside raw materials, also documents, evidence, certificates or similar things may serve as materials
- A *component*
    - One of several parts that together make up a whole machine
    - With regard to a product, components are goods that become part of a product during manufacturing (e.g. through installation) or arise from a product during disposal
- Dimensions of a Good
    - The nature of goods
        - Material goods are produced or traded mainly by companies in the industrial sector
        - Goods of non-material nature, such as information, tend to be produced, compiled or traded by companies in the service industry sector.
    - The use of goods
        - Investment goods are utilized by the consumer mainly to develop and manufacture other goods
        - Consumer goods are mainly intended for direct consumption.
    - the degree of comprehensiveness of a product
    - The product life cycle
    - Assignment of Terms to Value-added Management

Three organizational units in a logistics chain

A *Supply Chain* is the global network to deliver products and services from raw materials to end customers through an engineered flow of information, physical goods, and cash

Supply chain managemtn (SCM) is the design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities. 
SCM is applied to the comprehensive supply chain, that is, along the entire product life cycle, within and across companies.

#### 5.2 Strategies in the Entrepreneurial Context
- Target Area Quality: (Effectiveness)
    - Main objective
- Target Area Costs: (Efficiency)
    - Main objective
- Target Area Delivery: (Effectiveness)
    - Main objective
- Target Area Flexibility: (Potentials in the future / developing the business model)
    - Main objective

Opportuneness and Opportunity Costs

- Opportuneness
  - is the suitability of an action in a particular situation.
- Opportunity costs
  - is defined as the return on capital that could have resulted, had the capital been used for some purpose other than its present use.

Potential for Conflicting Entrepreneurial Objectives

#### 5.3 Performance Measuremenet
 - Logistics Performance Indicators
   - ... analyze the effect of logistics on company objectives in the four target areas of quality, cost, delivery, and flexibility
   - In the following, we introduce a balanced set of global measures from a logistics perspective
     -> also requirement of balanced scorecard
 - Practical Applicability of Performance Indicators in the Form of Practical Methods
- Too general performance indicators
    - Easily measurable, but
    - Often general and qualitative in meaning
    - No practical steps can be derived from them without making additional, non-quantitative, and implicit assumptions
- Lack of comprehensive measurement methods
    - Simple, applicable performance indicators often cannot be measured directly.
- Distortion of the processes
    - Each measurement affects the process being measured
 - Practical Applicability of Performance Indicators in the Form of Practical Methods
    - Meaning of the performance indicators
        - The absolute value of a performance indicator has little meaning as such.
    - Comparability of performance indicators
        - Benchmarking against competitors has meaning only if the competitor has used the same measurement
    - Practical applicability in supply chains
        - All of the important performance indicators can be applied in the total logistics network as well as in teh individual company
- Target area Quality
    - Scrap factor (or yield factor)
    - Complaint rate
- Target area Delivery
    - Fill rate or customer service ratio
        - Number of products delivered on desired delivery date divided by number of products orddered
    - Delivery reliability rate
        - Number of products delivered on onfirmed delivery date divided by number of confirmed products
    - Lot size (batch size)
    - Capacity utilization
    - Value-added rate of lead time
    - Variance in work content
    - Response time
    - Order confirmation time
- Target area Costs
    - Stock-inventory turnover
    - Work-in-process-inventory turnover
    - Work center efficiency

### 6 Risk Management
#### 6.1 What is risk?
 - Definition of Risk: risk = uncertainty + damage, risk = hazard / safeguards

 - Industrial risks
    - Change in technology, productivity, prices
    - False estimates of the rated capacity.
    - Time needed for the construction and running-in periods, political, social, and business environment
 - Operational risks
    - Lack of entrepreneurship skills.
    - Poor understanding of market dynamics.
    - Poorly available consultancy services and information systems.
    - Poor understanding of how to prepare a business plan
    - Natural risk (ice cream, energy companies, constructor companies)
 - Market risks
    - Unforeseeable inflation and exchange rates change.
    - Customer behaviors to buy foreign goods.
    - Inadequate infrastructure.
    - Shrinking market because of foreign competitors.
    - Defaulting or insolvency, Credit risks
- Cultural risks
- Natural risks (Hailstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes, dry seasons, and other natural hazards
- Economic and political risks

*Role*

- 1) asset the risks faced by the firm,
- 2) communicate these risks to those who make risk-taking decisions for the firm,
- 3) manage and monitor those risks to make sure that the firm only bears the risks its management and board of directors want it to bear.
    (i) A firm specifies a risk measure that it focuses on together with additional risk metrics.
    (ii) When that risk measure exceeds the firm's tolerance for risk, risk is reduced.
    (iii) Alternatively, when the risk measure is too low for the firm's risk tolerance, the firm increases its risk.

#### 6.2 Principles of management
Strategic Objectivs -> Risk Assessment (identification, description, estimation) -> Risk Reporting -> Risk Treatment -> Monitoring

#### 6.3 Power law risks
- Much Risk lies in false assumptions
- Normal distribution has characteristic scale
- Probability density functions
- **Power laws and large risks**
    - Power laws are ubiquitous
    - They express scale invariance
    - Probability of large excursion
        - example of height vs wealth
    - Gaussian approach inappropriate: underestimation of the real risks
        - Markowitz mean-variance protfolio
    - Black-Scholes option pricing and hedging
    - Asset valuation (CAPM, APT, factor models)
    - Financial crashes
- Take Home
  - Failures can usually be associated with the progressive maturation of a complex system maturing progressively towards an instability (multiple entangled causes interacting with positive feedbacks).
  - System of testing and validation designed to catch such problems
    - Catastrophes occur when this system fails
  - In most cases, it takes a failure of both engineering practice and of management 
  - Reliable entrepreneurship and management depends not on developing flawless processes but on how good we are at:
    - Communication (sharing information between teams)
    - Management (of Resources and Risk)
    - Verification and Validation
    - Risk Identification and tracking
    - Questioning assumptions

The boiling frog story
    - The delayed response problem
    - Crises often result from a progressive maturation towards an instability (bifurcation)

#### 6.4 Creep concept and advanced diagnostics
- Signs of Upcoming transitions
 - Slower recovery from perturbations
 - Increasing (or decreasing) autocorrelation
 - Increasing (or decreasing) cross-correlation with external driving
 - Increasing variance
 - Flickering and stochastic resonance
 - Increased spatial coherence
 - Degree of endogeneity/reflexivity
 - Super-exponential growth with positive feedbacks
- Humanity in the Anthropocene

#### 6.5 Risk Management failtures
- Six types of RM failture

1. Mismeasurement of known risks
2. Failure to use appropriate risk metrics
3. Failure to take risks into account
4. Failure in communicating the risks to top management
5. Failure in monitoring risks
6. Failure in managing risks

- Examples: 
 - Shuttle Flight 51-L(Challenger) 1986
   - Technical cause
   - Factors
 - Ariane-5 flight 501 1996
 - Space Shuttle Columbia disaster 2003
 - Deepwater Horizon oil spill
  
### 7. Technology and Innovation Management
A Bug's Life: Three challenges: the leaf as an obstacle, there is a gap in the production line, failure in the harvesting machine - hit the princess

#### 7.1 Exploitation and exploration
 - Exploitation: Refinement, production, efficiency, implementation
 - Exploration: Variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility 

- Polaroid, and digital imaging
- Ambidexterity
- Ecosystems challenges on innovators
- Strategizing in an ecosystem
 - Innovative strategy
   - Set performance expectations and determine target market
 - Assess _interdependence risk_ of coordinating with complementary innovators
 - Assess _initiative risk_ of managing the local project
 - Assess _integration risk_ of having the solution adopted across the value chain
 - Modify performance expectations
- Michelin's PAX System
- Strategizing in a the PAX ecosystem
- Example: Digital Film
- Assessing coinnovation risk

### 8. Business and Macroeconomics
#### 8.1 Macroeconomics
 - We want to understand the economic environment in which businesses operate
    - Macroeconomics develops theoretical models that help to explain how the key economic variables in the economy are determined 
    - Macroeconomics answers questions like the following
       - Why is average income high in some countries and low in others?
        - the role of institutions and government policy
       - Why do prices rise rapidly in some time periods while they are more stable in others?
        - the role of monetary policy
       - Why do production and employment expand in some years and contract in others?
        - the role of monetary and fiscal policy
 - GDP(Y): Consumption(C), Investment(I), Goverment Purchases(G), Net Exports(NX=X-M) (exports minus imports)
   - Y = C + I + G + NX

       = C^dom + C^for + I^dom + I^for + G^dom + G^for + X - (C^for + I^for + G^for)

       = C^dom + I^dom + G^dom + X

#### 8.2 Forecasting methods
 - Short-Run Economic Developments
   - Economic activity fluctuates form year to year
     - In most years production of goods and services rises
     - In some years normal growth does not occur, causing a recession
   - Economic fluctuations are irregular and difficult to predict
     - Fluctuations in the economy are often called the business cycle
   - Most macroeconomic variables fluctuate together
     - Most macroeconomic variables that measure some type of income or production fluctuate closely together
     - Although many macroeconomic variables fluctuate together, they fluctuate by different amounts
   - As output falls, unemployment rises
     - Changes in real GDP are inversely related to changes in the unemployment rate
     - During times of recession, unemployment rises substantially
- Different definitions of business cycles
 - Business cycles are recurrent sequences of alternating phases of expansion and contraction in economic activity
 - The name `business cycle' has some ambiguity, since it can refer to conceptually different economic fluctuation
  - Classical cycle
    - Fluctuations in the level of the economic activity
  - Growth cycle
    - Fluctuations in the economic activity around the long-run potential level
  - Growth rate cycle
    - Fluctuations of the growth rate of economic activity

 - Indicator approach
   - Business tendency surveys
   - Buildings permits
   - Job advertisements
 - Econometric approaches
   - Time series econometrics
   - Structural economdetric models

### 9. Introduction to Strategic Management
- What is Strategy and Strategic Management?
  - Whether a firm achieves competitive advantage is a function of a complex mix of factors internal and external to the firm, and the strategic choices taken by decision makers (e.g. TMT, CEO)
  - *The Strategy Process*: A set of analyses and choices that increase the likelihood of developing a strategy that generates a competitive advantage

- Why is strategy important?
 - Industry vs. Firm Effects in Performance

#### 9.1 A brief history of the strategy field
 - Managers need strategy in order to position their firms relative to its competitors
 - Strategy has often been reveals after the fact - by looking at successful and unsuccessful strategic moves by firms
 - The strategy discipline (practioners, consultants, academics) have sought to find ``rules of conduct'' that can predict successful strategic moves
 - Strategy research is based on statistical analysis of many firms, and single cases of successful and less successful firms

 1950's Phase I Financial planning (Functional control) -> 1960's Phase II Long range planning (Planning for growth Resource allocation) -> 1970's Phase III Strategic planning (Response to markets, Alternative strategies) -> 1980's Phase IV Strategic Management (Strategic processes, Competitive positioning) -> 1990's Phase V Quest for Strat Advantage (Capabilities, Resources) -> 2000's Phase V New Economy (Business Models, Disruptive technologies)

 - Several forces push towards a rethinking of strategic management
    - Structural change
    - Deregulation
    - Scarcity of expertise
    - Mergers transforming industries
    - Environmental concerns
    - New industry substitutes
    - Rapidly changing customer expectations
    - Rate of innovations
    - Increased entrepreneurial activity
    - Global competition

  -> Pressure for radical rethinking

 - Development in the discipline
  - Knowledge and technology
  - Processes and routines
  - History and path-dependence
  - Cooperation and networks

  - Resource-based history
  - Knowledge-based view
  - Capabilities-based view
  - Entrepreneurial view

#### 9.2 Strategic management process
  - How does strategy come about?
    - Strategic Planning
    - Scenario Planning
    - Str. as Planned Emergence
  - Top-down rational planning
    - Define mission, vision & goal (strategic intent)
    - External analysis of opportunities and threats
    - Internal analysis of strengths and weaknesses

#### 9.3 Competitive strategy
 - Creating and maintaining a competitive advantage in each and every area of business
 - Industry structure determines the profitability
    - Soft Drinks, Software, Pharmaceuticals
    - The five-forces model
      - Suppliees, Potential new entrants, Buyers, Substitutes, Industry competitors
 - *Cost leadership*
    - A company prices around the market average, and enjoys superior profits because its costs are lower than those of its rivals
    - Sources:  - Size differences and economies of scale
              - Experience differences learning-economies
              - Differential low-cost access to factors of production
              - Technological advantage independent of scale
              - Policy choices
 - *Differentiation*
    - A company adds value in areas of significance for the customer, who then accepts a premium price for distinctiveness of products and services
    - Sources:  - Product features
              - Linkages between functions and complexity
              - Timing
              - Location and presence
              - Product mix
              - Links with other firms
              - Reputation

- Four levels of competitive advantage
  - Competitive disadvantage: The firm is implementing a value-destroying strategy leading to cost-disadvantage or a product that does not satisfy customer needs.
  - Competitive party: The firm and its competitors are implementing the same value-creating strategies leading to cost-advantages and/or differentiation advantages.
  - Sustainable competitive advantage: A firm is alone in implementing a value-creating strategy leading to cost and/or differentiation advantages. Competitors are unable to duplicate the benefits of this strategy.

- Profitability ratios in strategy
     - Return on total assets (ROA)
     - Return on equity (ROE)
     - Gross profit margin
     - Earnings per share (EPS)
     - Price-earning ratio
     - Cash flow per share

### 11. Corporate Renewal
#### 11.1 Strategic Management Process
 - Performance management
    Key problems:
    - Measurement systems are too complicated and too differentiated
    - Most of the key indicators look into the past and are not suited to predict the future
    - Most of the key indicators report financial aspects. Non-monetary issues are not addressed
 - The balanced scorecard concept I
   - translates mission and strategy to targets and key indicators
   - creates a framework, a language to communicate mission and strategy
   - key indicators are used to inform employees about present and future success
   - orientation of the entire organization in the direction of the long-term targets
 - The balanced scorecard collects key figures from the following areas
   - _Financial dimension_: classic key financial figures, particularly for shareholders
   - _Market and customer dimensions_: form the customer opinion and customer attitude towards the company
   - _Process and resource dimension_: describe how well or how poorly internal processes function in terms of time, quality, costs
   - _Innovation and employee dimension_: describe to what extent the company is focused on future developments and to what extent it influences employees and their commitment
 - Review of the enterprise's strategic position
   - The change curve
     [Graph]
   - |   |Anticipatory |Reactive |Crisit
     |Strategic
     |Organizational
     | Leadership
- Introduction
   - Optimization in the company (see business model) vs. fundamental change in the company
   - Scope of fundamental change
     (the company's overall embedment in the environment, value creation, type and manner of value creation). 
   - Far-reaching changes in the strategic emphasis - value proposition / defendable competitive advantage
   - The influence also on organizational identify / values: core purpose and values
   - The example of SIG
     (from weapons/railway cars to packaging machines).
   - Renewal means strategic shift:
     - Strategic repositioning
     - Business process redesign (BRP)
     - Venture creation (business creation)
 - Change management as prerequisite
   - Change management process of great importance
     1. Establish a sense of urgency
     2. Form a powerful guiding coalition
     3. Create a vision
     4. Communicate the vision
     5. Empowering others to act on the vision
     6. Planning for and creating short-term wins
     7. Consolidating improvements and producing mroe change
     8. Institutionalizing new approaches

#### 11.2 Forms of Renewal
 - Strategic repositioning I
   - A company must havge clear positioning, defendable competitive advantages
     - Differentiation to competition is decisive 
     - Where do I play
   - Selection between 1-to-2 strategic emphases such as:
     - Cost leadership
     - Price leadership
     - Innovation leadership
     - Quality leadership
   - Strategic repositioning means changing strategic emphases
     - The technology basis used
     - The target price level
     - Backwards-/forwards integration
     - Including customers and suppliers into service innovations
     - Outsourcing or insourcing services
     - Shifting communication forms and channels
     - Changing distribution channels and forms
 - Financial dimension
 - Market and customer dimensions
 - Process and resource dimension
 - Innovation and employee dimension
 - Business Process Redesign
    - Information technology as an "enabler" of innovations
      - BPR combines the fundamental changes of a company, from function oriented ot process oriented, with the creation of innovative processes on the basis of new information technology.
      - Internal less external process innovatiosn
    - First phase: redesigning distribution logistics
      - Through the use of operational information-processing systems, integrated information systems make it possible to optimize individual tayloristic corporate functions: e.g., finance processes, porduction planning and managing systems, sales systems
      - Efficiency in the individual processes is high but the processes are isolated from one another
         -> Function-oriented management and remuneration models
    - Second phase: key process indicators
      - The efficient coordination of all processes, as opposed to the efficiency of the individual processes, is decisive
      - The basis to achieve this is the company-wide integration of an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP System) such as SAP R/3
      - Process orientation vs. function orientation
 - From function orientaion to process orientation III
   - The most significant characeristics of innovatino through BPR:
     - Effectiveness has priority over efficiency - key question: Are we producing the right products and services? Satisfying customer needs is the focus.
     - BPR is more than optimization. Begin with a "green field initiative" - process vision. Then further develop the given facts into a realistic, desired process environment, then deploy and practice continuous improvement
   - Process orientation requires process leadership. The process manager is responsible for the entire process
   - Key process indicators as controlling parameters, and a remuneration system that is based on these controlling parameters
 - From function orientaion to process orientation IV
   - People are at the center
   - Routines, privileges, power that employees have established and built up over years are questioned
   - Change management is a decisive factor for success/ failure
 Business process redesign (BPR)
   - From process orientation to the networking company I
     - From the integration of internal process to the coordination of inter-company processes
     - Internet as a central information network that spans all units/ departments
     - Big changes required to move from a process to a network company
       - Suppliers must be partners and not "opponents"
       - The example of Zara
   - From process orientation to the networking company II
     - The most important characteristics of innovation through networking are
       - Reciprocal uses as the central model of thought: win-win situation
       - People initiate and conclude networks: trust is essential
       - Integration and standards are technical prerequisites

### 12. Marketing
- Foundations
    (Why) do firms need Marketing/ Marketing Research?
     - Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department.
     - Marketing takes a day to learn. Unfortunately it takes a lifetime to master.
     - If I'd asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a fast horse
     - It's not the customer's job to know what they want
- Often misunderstood: customer orientation does not necessarily mean that companies do exactly what (single) customers want and/or say
    - Primary marketing research in the form of customer surveys is only one form of marketing research that is typically used for minor adaptions or improvements in customer service
    - Organizations that believe they have to agree with everything that the customers say will often fail
    - Nevertheless, successful innovation always addresses (often latent) customer needs, although customers are often not able to articulate what they need
    - Need for marketing research that discovers latent needs (from qualitative methods to large databases)
 
 Example: Segway
	- Questions incorrect
    - Conclusion: Marketing is fundamentally concerned with the firms' relationships to customers
     - The customers' needs and wishes are THE driving force not only behind marketing, but also behind the firm in general!
     - Meeting customer wants and needs better than the competition is a firms' most critical success factor, and a central marketing task!
      - All areas of the firm, especially its leadership, need to "live and think marketing"
      - For solving managerial questions, it is essential to acquire and extend marketing knowledge and marketing information
    - Marketing as Exchange
      - Buyer, Seller
    - Why should the entire organization be involved in marketing
      - Marketing as a Leadership Philosophy
      - The marketing Orientation
      - Assumption: Achieving organizational goals depends on determining the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired products, services and solutions more effectively and efficiently than competitors do
      - There are good reasons to believe that in free market-based economies, market(ing) orientation is superior to alternative orientations
 - The Four "Ps" of the Marketing Mix
    - Product, Price, Promotion, Place
 - The Three "Rs" Relationship Management
     Relationship Management: The process of creating, maintaining, and enhancing strong relationships with customers and other stakeholders
    - Recruitment, Retention, Recovery
    - Relationship Management Baasis
        Customer Lifetime Value (formula)

### 13. Corporate Sustainability
#### 13.1 Motivations of Firms to Act towards Sustainability
- The sustainability triangle
   - **Economic**: An *economically* suitainable system must be able to supply mankind with goods and services on a continuing basis.
   - **Social**: A *socially* sustainable system must achieve distributional equity, adequate provision of social services including health and education, gender equality, and political accountability and participation.
   - **Ecological**: An *environmentally* sustainable system must, among others, maintain a stable resource base, avoiding over-exploitation of renewable resource systems or environmental sink functions.

  Depletion of natural resources
    - Humanity's ecological footprint is over 50% larger than what the planet can regenerate
    - Business as usual might reduce quality of life of future generations
  
  Emissions
	- Man-made greenhouse gas emissions lead to global climate change
	- Climate change connected with enormous environmental and social implications (e.g., floodings, droughts), especially in poor countries
    
  Social inequality
     - Income inequality in almost all countries in on the rise
     - Countries build wealth on debts at the expense of future generations
 
 - 4 perspectives why corporate sustainability matters
   - Market perspective, legal perspective, social perspective, ecological perspective
   - motivation, threat-driven strategy, opportunity-driven strategy, main theory
   
   Example: British Petroleum, Tesla Motors, Pacific Gas & Electric, Vattenfall Europe, Fishery

#### 13.2 Central Concepts in the Context of Corporate Sustainability
   - Corporate sustainability: some core concepts
       - Corporate Governance: *organizational and structural aspects of companies*
       - Corporate Citizenship: *protection and support of social,civil and political rights*
       - Corporate Philanthropy: *initiatives outside the direct business*
       - Corporate Social Responsibility: *on a voluntary basis within core business activities*
       - Corporate Sustainability: *corporate strategies built around social and environmental considerations*

	Corporate Environmental Evolutionary Path

    Pollution Denial -(obligation)-> End-of-pipe regulation -(opportunity)-> greening -(reorientation)-> beyond greening
